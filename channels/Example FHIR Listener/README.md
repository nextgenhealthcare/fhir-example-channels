# Example FHIR Listener
This sample channel is intended as a starting point to teach you the basics of FHIR resources/interactions and how the FHIR Listener works with them. From here, feel free to tweak the destinations or add more as you see fit. The trial-use standard basically just tells you what to do with resources (create them, update them, etc.), and you can use Mirth Connect to customize the actual implementation however you wish.

This channel is dependent on the following code template libraries:
- FHIR Helper Functions
- FHIR DB Operations
